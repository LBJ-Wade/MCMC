For precessing templates, the following function is called in order to rotate the orientation of the system from OrbitalL  ( L=(0,0,1) N = (-sin(inc),0,cos(inc)) into an orientation where L is in the x-z plane and N along z (i.e. N=0,0,1)==>  [XLALSimInspiralInitialConditionsPrecessingApproxs](http://software.ligo.org/docs/lalsuite/lalsimulation/group___l_a_l_sim_inspiral_spin_taylor__c.html#gadc3d6ebbe9e62c8d7ea93b489db00bdb)\n",
    "This output is *required* by precessing waveforms routines. This then gets passed into the waveform driver routine such as [XLALSimInspiralSpinTaylorT4](http://software.ligo.org/docs/lalsuite/lalsimulation/group___l_a_l_sim_inspiral_spin_taylor__c.html#ga43f8a11e72b41797fef44c7b2134a1ba)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point here is that N does NOT equal (-sin(inc),0,cos(inc)) at the end of all the rotations of LALSimInspiralTransformPrecessingNewInitialConditions despite the documentation claiming that it does. It in fact is  (sin(inc),0,cos(inc)). At no point is a rotation done to fix this (as far as I can see) before going into XLALSimInspiralInitialConditionsPrecessingApproxs which then does a rotation that WILL NOT get N to be along Z but in some arbitrary direction. Therefore, N and L will not oriented in such a way as is expect from the precessing waveform driving functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As salvo discovered the issue appears to be rotation 6 done in LALSimInspiralTransformPrecessingNewInitialConditions\n",
    "in the code below this rotation has is surrounded by two astericks. That rotation should NOT be -phiN but LAL_PI-phiN.\n",
    "\n",
    "I realize that this links to doxygen that may be for the current master branch or out of date. Therefore, I am directly linking the code of the two functions in question for the cgit. In addition, I am fairly convinced of the above workflow for template generation by MCMC. If someone would like to correct me and say these functions are not called that is fine, or that the orientations are in fact fine and it is a documentation (major) flaw that is fine. Otherwise I am pretty sure that the precessing waveform driving routines are being passed S1 and S2 values calculated in a frame that they do NOT expect or want.\n",
